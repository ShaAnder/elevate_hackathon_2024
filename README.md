As part of the **Code Institute's October 2024 Hackathon**, Team 3: The Gig Getters built from scratch a project called **"Job.Me"**. This entirely free all-in-one platform was designed to provide Software Developers with a comprehensive suite of resources to help them secure their ideal roles. Tailored to developers of all technical backgrounds, skill levels, and experience, this one-stop-shop simplifies job hunting while offering:

- Mock interview simulations
- Progress tracking tools
- Coding challenges
- Access to key tech stacks like Python, JavaScript, and SQL

With full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionalities, users can easily manage profiles and track progress. It also includes interactive features like a **card carousel** for exploring top interview questions, helping developers deepen their skills in relevant tech stacks.

Built using modern technologies such as **Bootstrap** and **Django**, "Job.Me" also provides Users with a **responsive design**, **dark mode toggling**, and **mobile-friendly navigation**. Its dynamic interface ensures developers are well-prepared to pursue roles that align with their career goals.
